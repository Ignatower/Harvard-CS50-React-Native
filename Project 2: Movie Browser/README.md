For this project, you'll be implementing a movie browser. It will allow users to
search for movies included in the [Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
and view additional information about any movies they select. Check out the
[staff solution](#staff-solution) for a working version.

## Requirements

- You may not import libraries other than the below:
  - `expo`
  - `react`
  - `react-native`
  - `prop-types`
  - `react-navigation`
  - Any library for icons
- There should be at least one `StackNavigator`
- There should be a search screen that allows users to search for movies
  - You should show more than 10 results if more than 10 results exist
- There should be a screen that shows additional information about a selected movie

The aesthetics of the app are up to you!
