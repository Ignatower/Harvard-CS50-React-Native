# Harvard CS50 React Native

These are some of the projects that I implemented taking the course (https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-mobile-app-development-with-react-native). The README file for each project consists of the animated GIF of the UI, the course assignments, the instructions for installing the code, and the url of the published app.
